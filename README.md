## 📌 Workflow Overview

1. **Data Exploration & Cleaning**
2. **Visualization** of relationships (e.g., charges vs BMI)
3. **Feature Encoding** (LabelEncoding, OneHotEncoding)
4. **Train-Test Split**
5. **Model Training** (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, etc.)
6. **Performance Evaluation** (R² Score, MAE, MSE)
7. **Result Interpretation & Conclusions**

## 📈 Sample Insights

- Smokers have **much higher insurance charges**.
- BMI and age have a strong correlation with cost.
- Region has minor impact compared to smoking and BMI.
